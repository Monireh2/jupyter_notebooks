    "# How to use a single value to update multiple tensors with scan in TensorFlow\n",
    "I assume that you have TensorFlow that you want to update with a sequence such that you will be using the previous values of the tensor at each update. E.g. you have a neural network that you'd like to update with a point at time t in a sequence and values from the network at time t-1. If you want to see this in full-fledged use, look at my other blog post where I recreate the Variational Recurrent Neural Network!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the [definition of scan](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scan):\n",
    "```\n",
    "tf.scan(\n",
    "    fn,\n",
    "    elems,\n",
    "    initializer=None,\n",
    "    parallel_iterations=10,\n",
    "    back_prop=True,\n",
    "    swap_memory=False,\n",
    "    infer_shape=True,\n",
    "    name=None\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "fn should follow the form `fn(parameter_that_changes,parameter_you_change_with)`. This means that you can assume that your input from elem will always go to `parameter_you_change_with`, and that what you return should be `parameter_that_changes`.\n",
    "Writing it like a function looks something like the following\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fn(x, elem):\n",
    "    return new_x\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `new_x` will be `x` the next time `fn` is called. That took me some time to figure out."

    "* You can have all your values inside a single tensor for the initializer and update them via indexing. This also doesn't work. i.e. with `T=tf.concat([a1,a2,a3])`, you can't do `T[0]=x`\n",
    "* I spent a long time trying to manually concatonate the values so that I could track them in the future only to learn that scan does this by default!! E.g., for a1, the corresponding output vector is `[a1+1, a1+1+2, a1+1+2+3]` since the elements were `[1,2,3]`.\n",
